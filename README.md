### Hi there 👋
My name is Andrew Alderfer and I'm a data scientist and artist with a background in fabrication, and manufacturing for the events and furniture industries. I love designing machines and processes for manufacturing and hope to apply my new skills and knowledge in machine-learning and AI to improve automation systems. I recently graduated from Flatiron School in NYC and am excited to continue to use this space to develop my ideas and projects.

Recently:

- Modified monkeytype so that I can read Moby Dick and improve my touch typing at the same time.
- Worked on a customized implementation of the YOLO algorithm using Tensorflow/Keras
- Working on a screw sorting machine with darknet YOLO.
- Think about learning robotics simulation. If you have suggestions on which engine (Bullet, Havok, Physx, etc.) to learn to use let me know!
- Used the OpenAI api to build a simple Jupyter Notebook based AI Assistant that can write cover letters and anything else I might need.
- Living in Brooklyn
- Looking for Work!
