### Hi there 👋
My name is Andrew Alderfer and I'm a data scientist and artist with a background in fabrication, and manufacturing for the events and furniture industries. I love designing machines and processes for manufacturing and hope to apply my new skills and knowledge in machine-learning and AI to improve automation systems. I recently graduated from Flatiron School in NYC and am excited to continue to use this space to develop my ideas and projects.

I am currently:

- I modified monkeytype so that I can read Moby Dick and improve my touch typing at the same time.
- Becoming an expert (by doing it over an over) in installing Customized Windows 11 iso's and Arch Linux for a dual boot setup, lol.
- Working on a customized implementation of the YOLO algorithm using Tensorflow/Keras
- Building a screw sorting machine with darknet YOLO.
- I want to start learning robotics simulation. If you have suggestions on which engine (Bullet, Havok, Physx, etc.) to learn to use let me know!
- I used the OpenAI api to build a simple Jupyter Notebook based AI Assistant that can write cover letters and anything else I might need.
- Living in Brooklyn
- Looking for Work!
