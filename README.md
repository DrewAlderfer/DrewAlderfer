### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Andrew Alderfer and I'm a data scientist and artist with a background in fabrication, and manufacturing for the events and furniture industries. I love designing machines and processes for manufacturing and hope to apply my new skills and knowledge in machine-learning and AI to improve automation systems. I recently graduated from Flatiron School in NYC and am excited to continue to use this space to develop my ideas and projects.

I am currently:

- Looking for Work!
- Working on a customized implementation of the YOLO algorithm using Tensorflow/Keras
- Building machines and 3d printing tools
- Living in Brooklyn
